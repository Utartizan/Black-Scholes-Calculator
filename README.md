# Black Scholes Calculator

**This was my first actual project on R to create a black scholes calculator.**
The code features obtaining the values of specific options from three types of portfolios involving three different companies: Rivian, META, and LLoyds.
Which then takes up all the values and displays the relevant greeks to tell you how risky the options investments would be, etc.
Upon running, it will also show you the values in the form of Excel files. You can take a look and it'll display several types of greeks.

## How to replicate results
1. Download the zip file
2. Run the R script on R Studio
3. Select the entire code and run the program

# Notes:
This isn't the best project, however it was the start of my journey to learning R.
The results will be in the console hightlighted in white.
